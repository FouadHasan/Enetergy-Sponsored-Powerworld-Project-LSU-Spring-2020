# Enetergy-Sponsored-Powerworld-Project-LSU-Spring-2020
This lab is developed by LSU jointly with Enetergy to train LSU electrical engineering students in PowerWorld software. I have actively participated in developing this course materilas and lecture slides. PowerWorld is a popular power system simulation software. It is extensively used in planning and market analysis. It supports Steady-State Power System Security Analysis, Transient Stability Analysis, Power System Economics and Market Modeling etc. The student version is available in https://www.powerworld.com/
